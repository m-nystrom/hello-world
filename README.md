# hello-world

Hello,

I am currently a student seeking an AAS degree in computer programming, with an emphasis in Java programming
and web development. I've worked with Java, javascript, jQuery, jsp, servlets, php, bootstrap, angularjs,
ajax, SQL, and some other languages/frameworks throughout my coursework, but I'm interested in any other 
technologies that will broaden my knowledge in the programming world and improve my skills as a programmer.
